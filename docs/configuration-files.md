# Configuration Files

Amethyst will pick up a config file located at `~/.amethyst.yml` or `~/.config/amethyst/amethyst.yml` in this order. A sample can be found at [/.amethyst.sample.yml](../.amethyst.sample.yml)

## How the file is applied

- The file is read once, at launch. After editing it, relaunch Amethyst (`mod2 + z` by default).
- Every key present in the file overwrites the stored setting for that key. A key that is *absent* leaves the previously stored value in place, so to turn something off write `key: false` rather than deleting the line.
- Unknown keys are ignored without a warning. If a setting seems to have no effect, check its spelling against the tables below first.

## Configuration Keys

| Key | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `layouts` | Ordered list of layouts to use by layout key (default tall, wide, fullscreen, and column). |
| `mod1` | First mod (default option + shift). |
| `mod2` | Second mod (default option + shift + control). |
| `mod3` | Third mod (default option + shift + command). |
| `mod4` | Fourth mod (not used by default). |
| `window-max-count` | The max number of windows that may be visible on a screen at one time before additional windows are minimized. A value of 0 disables the feature. |
| `window-margins` | Boolean flag for whether or not to add margins between and around windows (default `false`). |
| `smart-window-margins` | With `window-margins` enabled, drop the margins while only one tiled window is on a screen's current space, and bring them back once a second one is tiled (default `false`). Floating windows and windows on other displays do not count. The Fullscreen layout never applies margins while this is on. |
| `window-margin-size` | The size of the margins between and around windows (in px, default `0`). |
| `window-minimum-height` | The smallest height that a window can be sized to regardless of its layout frame (in px, default `0`). |
| `window-minimum-width` | The smallest width that a window can be sized to regardless of its layout frame (in px, default `0`) |
| `floating` | List of bundle identifiers for applications to either be automatically floating or automatically tiled based on `floating-is-blacklist` (default `[]`). |
| `floating-is-blacklist` | Boolean flag determining behavior of the `floating` list. `true` if the applications should be floating and all others tiled. `false` if the applications should be tiled and all others floating (default `true`). |
| `ignore-menu-bar` | `true` if screen frames should exclude the status bar. `false` if the screen frames should include the status bar (default `false`). |
| `float-small-windows` | `true` if windows smaller than the `small-window-size` threshold should be floating by default (default `true`). |
| `small-window-size` | Pixel threshold for `float-small-windows`. Windows with both width and height below this value are considered small (in px, default `500`). |
| `mouse-follows-focus` | `true` if the mouse should move position to the center of a window when it becomes focused (default `false`). Note that this is largely incompatible with `focus-follows-mouse`. |
| `focus-follows-mouse` | `true` if the windows underneath the mouse should become focused as the mouse moves (default `false`). Note that this is largely incompatible with `mouse-follows-focus` |
| `mouse-swaps-windows` | `true` if dragging and dropping windows on to each other should swap their positions (default `false`). |
| `mouse-resizes-windows` | `true` if changing the frame of a window with the mouse should update the layout to accommodate the change (default `false`). Note that not all layouts will be able to respond to the change. |
| `enables-layout-hud` | `true` to display the name of the layout when a new layout is selected (default `true`). |
| `enables-layout-hud-on-space-change` | `true` to display the name of the layout when moving to a new space (default `true`). |
| `enables-window-count-hud` | `true` to display notifications when window max count changes (default `false`). |
| `focused-window-border` | Draw an outline just outside the focused window (default `true`). Only windows Amethyst manages get one; Spotlight and ignored apps do not. |
| `focused-window-border-color` | Outline colour as `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA` (default `#006400`, dark green). Quote it in YAML (`"#38c0ff"`) or drop the `#` (`38c0ff`): an unquoted `#` starts a YAML comment and the value is silently lost. |
| `focused-window-border-width` | Outline width in points (default `4`). `0` disables the outline. |
| `use-canary-build` | `true` to get updates to beta versions of the software (default `false`). |
| `new-windows-to-main` | `true` to insert new windows into the first position and `false` to insert new windows into the last position (default `false`). |
| `follow-space-thrown-windows` | `true` to automatically move to a space when throwing a window to it (default `true`). |
| `focus-follows-window-thrown-between-spaces-delay` | Seconds to wait before following a window thrown to another space (default `0.5`). |
| `application-activation-delay` | Seconds to wait after an application activates before reflowing its screen (default `0.2`). |
| `window-resize-step` | The integer percentage of the screen dimension to increment and decrement main pane ratios by (default `5`). |
| `screen-padding-left` | Padding to apply between windows and the left edge of the screen (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-right` | Padding to apply between windows and the right edge of the screen (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-top` | Padding to apply between windows and the top edge of the screen (in px, default `0`). |
| `screen-padding-bottom` | Padding to apply between windows and the bottom edge of the screen (in px, default `0`).
| `restore-layouts-on-launch` | `true` to maintain layout state across application executions (default `true`). |
| `debug-layout-info` | `true` to display some optional debug information in the layout HUD (default `false`). |
| `disable-padding-on-builtin-display` |  `true` to disable screen padding on in-built display (default `false`). |
| `hide-menu-bar-icon` | `true` to hide the menu bar icon (default `false`). |
| `show-space-indicator` | `true` to show the current space in the menu bar (default `false`). See the README's Space Indicator section. |
| `space-indicator-style` | `0` single icon, `1` one icon per monitor, `2` one icon per space (default `0`). |
| `space-indicator-color-style` | `0` bordered, `1` solid, `2` solid inverted (default `0`). |

## Commands

Commands are defined at the root of the config file, as either an object with `mod` and `key` values to customize the command or is `false` to entirely disable it.

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `mod` | The modifier to use, either `mod1`, `mod2`, `mod3` or `mod4`. |
| `key` | The key on the keyboard to use. |

### Mods

A mod is a list of keyboard modifiers. Namely, `option`, `control`, `shift`, and `command`.

### Layout Selection

Amethyst supports defining shortcuts for selecting specific layouts directly. They take the form of `select-${layout_key}-layout`. For example, defining the command `select-tall-layout` will define a shortcut that when used will switch directly to the Tall layout. Note, this works for custom layouts as well.
